<h1 align="center" id="title">Fake-News-Classifier</h1>

<p id="description">This tool is designed to help users distinguish between genuine and fabricated news articles by analyzing various textual features and patterns. By training on a curated dataset of news articles the logistic regression model has learned to make informed predictions contributing to the fight against misinformation.</p>

<h2> How it Works </h2>
<p>The Fake News Classifier employs a logistic regression model that has been trained on a diverse dataset of news articles. During the training process, the model learns to identify key linguistic and semantic characteristics that differentiate between real and fake news. These characteristics include vocabulary usage, sentence structure, sentiment, and contextual cues.

When presented with a new article, the classifier uses the patterns it has learned to assign a probability score representing the likelihood that the article is genuine. Based on this score, the tool then makes a binary classification decision, labeling the article as either "Real News" or "Fake News."</p>
